# Model Configuration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Groq Model Decommissioned ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` has been decommissioned by Groq
**Solution:** Updated to working Groq models:
- `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (fast, lightweight)
- `llama-3.2-3b-preview` (compact, efficient)
- `mixtral-8x7b-32768` (complex tasks)

### 2. Ollama Model Name Mismatch ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Config had `mistral:7b` but you're using `mishral:7b`
**Solution:** Updated all references to `mishral:7b`

## Updated Model Configuration:

### Available Models:
1. **Llama 3.1 8B Instant (Groq)** - Default, fast responses
2. **Llama 3.2 3B Preview (Groq)** - Compact model
3. **Mixtral 8x7B (Groq)** - Complex reasoning
4. **DeepSeek R1** - Advanced reasoning
5. **Mishral 7B (Local)** - Your Ollama model

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `config/app.config.ts` - Model definitions and API configuration
- ✅ `OLLAMA_SETUP.md` - Updated setup instructions for mishral:7b

## Current Status:
- ✅ Development server running at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Ready to test with your Ollama mishral:7b model

## Next Steps:
Since you're already running `ollama run mishral:7b`, you should now be able to:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Select "Mishral 7B (Local)" from the model dropdown
3. Generate code locally without API costs!

The Groq models should also work now since I've updated to currently supported models.
